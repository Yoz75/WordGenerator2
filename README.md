Word generator 2 (wg2 shortly) is a token based text generator. A tokenizer slices input text to small pieces (tokens) and remembers wich tokens go after wich. After a generator selects random token and creates next tokens in the chain. <br>
**THE MORE TEXT PROVIDED AS INPUT, THE BETTER RESULT WILL BE**. I think an acceptable amount would be 500-600 kilobytes
